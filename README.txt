Which level unit tests succeed completely -  Excellent

Which level unit tests succeed partially - Outstanding. All passed apart from the listMemberDetailsImperialAndMetric() method

Self reflection - Grading Spectrum Level: I believe I achieved the Excellent level. I have passed all the Excellent tests and most of the Outstanding ones.
The Assessment class is running. The trainer is able to add an assessment and update a comment from the menu.


A statement of how much of the application specification you implemented.

I did some work on the Student and Premium Classes but they are not implemented, nor is member assessment query support or the member progress sub menu
options. Overall I believe I acheived all of the Excellent specification level, and some of the Outstanding.

Any extra features you wish to bring to the assessors attention, i.e. extra functionality, Java syntax not covered in the lectures, non-standard Libraries used
